                    <p>On this 5 mile loop in the Sand to Snow National Monument you are almost guaranteed to see desert bighorn sheep. This is a strenuous hike on a steep narrow trail that is not maintained. If you have a fear of heights this is not the hike for you. With a 1500 foot gain and following a narrow ridge the trail is challenging. There is also opportunity to see mule deer, coyotes, jackrabbits, bobcats and antelope squirrel. With views of the Coachella Valley and the San Bernardino Mountains this is a spectacular hike. After the hike you have the option of enjoying a picnic lunch in the shade of mature cottonwoods.</p>
